  story: `NeurVana was born from the understanding that true wellness isn't achieved by escaping the body—but by learning to listen to it. Founded by a practitioner who witnessed the limits of surface-level healing, NeurVana emerged as a space where science and stillness converge. What began as a pursuit to understand human resilience has evolved into a neuroscience-based sanctuary for those ready to move beyond burnout and into balance. Every technique, every touch, and every experience at NeurVana is grounded in the pursuit of one truth: when the nervous system is at peace, the human potential expands.`,
  
  philosophy: `We believe that healing is both an art and a science. The nervous system is the bridge between the mind and the body, carrying the language of emotion, memory, and identity. At NeurVana, we work through this system—merging neuroscience, somatic intelligence, and sensory restoration—to create transformation from within. Our approach is not about temporary relief, but sustainable recalibration. We don't just relax the body; we reeducate it to remember its natural state of harmony.`
